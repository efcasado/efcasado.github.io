Hi! I am Enrique Fernandez, a Software Engineer based in Stockholm. I am
not Swedish though, but you probably already guessed that. I grew up in
the beautiful mediterranean city of Tarragona, where I also happened to
graduate in MSc Computer Science and Security and BSc Computer
Science from [Universitat Rovira i Virgili][urv].

I  currently work at [Erlang Solutions AB][esl], a leading consultancy
firm specialised in building scalable distributed solutions using the
Erlang programming language. As you can imagine, may daily work involves
writing lots of lines of Erlang code. From time to time, I also happen
to deliver Erlang courses to our customers. Moreover, I am an active member
of the [Stockholm Erlang User Group][seug].

Before joining Erlang Solutions AB in 2012, I worked at [Ericsson
Research][er] as a Research Engineer in the area of Content Delivery Networks
and Cloud Computing. Among other things, I was involved in the
development of several Cloud-related research projects (we were one
of the early adopters of OpenStack). I also contributed to secure
a handful of Cloud-related patents.

Last but not least, I started my professional career at [Arquitecturas
y Servicios Telemáticos][ast]. At that time, I would focus on conducting
state-of-the-art research on Distributed Systems and Peer-to-Peer Networks
under the supervision of PhD. Marc Sánchez and PhD. Pedro Garcia.
