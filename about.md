Hi! I am Enrique Fernandez, a Software Engineer based in Stockholm. I am
not Swedish though, but you probably already guessed that. I grew up in
the beautiful mediterranean city of Tarragona, where I also happened to
graduate in MSc Computer Science and Security and BSc Computer
Science from [Universitat Rovira i Virgili][urv].

I cannot conceive Software Engineering without a good dose of all these
three ingredients: technology, people and product. All three are equally
important to me and I'm constantly seeking to improve on all of them.

I consider myself an experience Erlang/Elixir developer who is not
afraid of using other programming languages when there is a needed for it.
R, Python and Ruby are just a few examples. I'm a Distributed Systems and
Functional Programming enthusiast. I wish days had more than 24 hours to
be able to delve into all the new developments in these two domains.
I don't like repetitive tasks, that is probably why I jumped into the
DevOps bandwagon as soon as I heard about it. Some of my favourites tools
in this domain are Ansible and Terraform. I can't develop software, ship
it to production and forget about it. This is probably why Graphite, Grafana
and Splunk are among the first services that I set up whenever I start
a new project. Cloud technologies and the new kid in the block, containers,
are one of my weaknesses. I have two obsessions: keeping everything under
version control and Dockerizing everything.

I currently work as a Lead Architect at [Derivco AB][der], a software
house that develops trailblazing technology for [Microgaming][mg], one of the
world's largest suppliers of online gaming. More concretely, my job
revolves around the Sports business unit, where we are tasked with
developing the platform that fuels [Betway][bw]'s Sportsbook. As the
Lead Architect in the Swedish branch, I am the most senior technical
member of the organisation. My functions span different aspects of the
organisation including, but not limited to: office management and
administration, communication with key stakeholders, product definition
and technical development.

Prior to joining Derivco in 2016, I worked at [Erlang Solutions AB][esl],
a leading consultancy firm specialised in building scalable distributed
solutions using the Erlang programming language. As you can imagine,
may daily work involved writing lots of lines of Erlang code for various
customers, Klarna being probably the most notorious one. From time to time,
I also happened to deliver Erlang courses to our customers. It was during
my days at Erlang Solutions that I discovered the local Erlang User Group
in Stockholm. You can check out some of my talks in my [SpeakersDeck][speakersdeck]
profile.

Before joining Erlang Solutions AB in 2012, I worked at [Ericsson
Research][er] as a Research Engineer in the area of Content Delivery Networks
and Cloud Computing. Among other things, I was involved in the
development of several Cloud-related research projects (e.g. we were one
of the early adopters of OpenStack). I also contributed to secure
a handful of Cloud-related patents.

Last but not least, I started my professional career at [Arquitecturas
y Servicios Telemáticos][ast] in 2009. At that time, I would focus on
conducting state-of-the-art research on Distributed Systems and Peer-to-Peer
Networks under the supervision of PhD. Marc Sánchez and PhD. Pedro Garcia.
As a result of my work at Architecturas y Servicios Telemáticos, I authored
a series of research papers that can be found in my [DBLP][dblp] profile.
